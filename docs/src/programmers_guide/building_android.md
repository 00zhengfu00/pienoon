Building for Android    {#pie_noon_guide_building_android}
====================


#### Version Requirements

Following are the minimum required versions for the tools and libraries you
need for building PieNoon for Android:

-   Android SDK:  Android 4.4 (API Level 19)
-   ADT: 20140702
-   NDK: android-ndk-r10
-   NDK plugn for Eclipse: Bundled with ADT

#### Before Building

-   Install the [Android SDK].
-   Install the [Android NDK].

#### Building

The PieNoon project has an `AndroidManifest.xml` file which contains details
about how to build an Android package (apk).

To build the project:

-   Open a command line window.
-   Go to the working directory containing the project to build.
-   Execute `build_apk_sdl.sh` to build.

For example:

    cd pie_noon
    ./build_apk_sdl.sh DEPLOY=0 LAUNCH=0

#### Installing and running the game.

`build_apk_sdl.sh` will also install and run the game after a build is
complete.

For example, the following will install and run the game on a device attached
to the workstation with serial number `ADA123123`.

    cd pie_noon
    ./build_apk_sdl.sh ADB_DEVICE=ADA123123

If only one device is attached to a workstation, the `ADB_DEVICE1 argument
can be ommitted.

#### Code Generation

By default, code is generated for devices that support the `armeabi-v7a` ABI.
Alternatively, you can generate a fat `.apk` that includes code for all ABIs.
To do so, override APP\_ABI on ndk-build's command line via `build_apk_sdl.sh`:

    ./build_apk_sdl.sh APP_ABI=all
