Cardboard Gameplay {#pie_noon_guide_gameplay_cardboard}
=====================

## Overview {#cardboard_gameplay_overview}

In this mode, you control the character directly with [Google Cardboard][],
selecting your targets just by looking at them, and throwing pies with
a flick of the switch.

Just like the standard game, the goal is to be the last player standing.
However, you cannot block in this mode, so you have to play carefully,
not letting the other players get the drop on you with a pie they've
been building up.

## Setup {#cardboard_gameplay_overview}

To play Cardboard mode, select "Game Modes" from the Pie Noon menu, then
"Cardboard". You can then insert your device into a Cardboard, and flick
the switch to start the game. Alternatively, you can touch the screen to
start, so you can still try it out, even without a Cardboard.

## Controls {#cardboard_gameplay_controls}

When the game starts, you will be right in the middle of Pie Noon action.
As you look around, you will see a target reticle appear on the other
characters you are currently looking towards. That is your current target,
and when you flick the switch (or touch the screen), you will throw your
pie at them.

You can also see a targeting arrow on the ground, pointed at the same
target. On the tip of that arrow are two important things about you, your
health, and your current pie size.

Unlike the normal game, you cannot block in cardboard mode. However, you
aren't completely defenseless. When you hit a player with your pie, they
fall down, droping their pie. So if you see someone aiming at you with a
big pie, be sure to take them out before they can get you.

After the game ends, it will return to the start of Cardboard mode, where
you can again flick the switch to start up a new game.
