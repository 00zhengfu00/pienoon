## Gameplay

Players control cardboard cutout characters on sticks arranged roughly in a
circle as part of a cardboard diorama.

To win a match, each player must try to cover their opponents with as much
pie filling as possible.  When a player is covered with too much filling
they're knocked out of the match.  The last player in the match is the winner.

To cover others with pie filling, players need to throw and successfully land
pies on their opponents.  It sounds simple but pies are not all made equal,
the longer a player waits to throw a pie the larger it will grow resulting in
more pie filling covering an opponent.  Players aren't entirely defenseless,
it's possible to block incoming pies and deflect them towards other players.
While blocking an incoming pie is deflected in the player's aim direction.
